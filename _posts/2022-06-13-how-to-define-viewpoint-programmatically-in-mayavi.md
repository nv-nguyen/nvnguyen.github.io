**Note**: If you have trouble installing Mayavi, you can take a look at my post: [How to install Mayavi](https://anhquancao.github.io/blog/2022/how-to-install-mayavi-with-python-3-on-ubuntu-2004-using-pip-or-anaconda/).

# Problem

Given the following Python code
```
import numpy as np
from mayavi import mlab

n = 8
t = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, n)
z = np.exp(1j * t)
x = z.real.copy()
y = z.imag.copy()
z = np.zeros_like(x)

triangles = [(0, i, i + 1) for i in range(1, n)]
x = np.r_[0, x]
y = np.r_[0, y]
z = np.r_[1, z]
t = np.r_[0, t]


mlab.triangular_mesh(x, y, z, triangles, scalars=t)
mlab.show()
```
When we run it, Mayavi draws the shape using the **default viewpoint**
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/fig_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
From the GUI, we can change easily the viewpoint by dragging the left mouse e.g. in the figure below
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

However, if we close the window and rerun the python code, Mayavi still usesthe **default viewpoint**. In this tutorial, I will show you how to obtain the code that draws the viewpoint you want and then how to put it in the python program.

# Find the code that generate the viewpoint you want 
- Click on the button highlighted in a red square below to open **Mayavi piplepline window**
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
- Click on the **red circle** to open. **Note:** The recording box must be checked. 
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
- Click  on the button highlighted in a red square below to view the object along the x axis 
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
Result
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
- Then, dragging the left mouse to change to the viewpoint you want. For example:
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
- Note that on the **Edit properties window**, the code used to change to te corresponding viewpoint has been generated 
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

# Put the generated code into the Python program
- Use the following code to get the  Mayavi **scene** object

```
figure = mlab.figure()
scene = figure.scene
```
- Replace all `scene.scene` to `scene`

```
scene.x_minus_view()
scene.camera.position = [-1.1437838116861252, -2.116527050821497, 5.572515456581492]
scene.camera.focal_point = [-0.04951556604879043, 0.0, 0.5]
scene.camera.view_angle = 30.0
scene.camera.view_up = [0.8794813509054432, 0.34100117306501826, 0.33201017059394156]
scene.camera.clipping_range = [3.545571276948115, 8.209200934599123]
scene.camera.compute_view_plane_normal()
scene.render()
```

- Put them together to the original Python program  

```
import numpy as np
from mayavi import mlab

n = 8
t = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, n)
z = np.exp(1j * t)
x = z.real.copy()
y = z.imag.copy()
z = np.zeros_like(x)

triangles = [(0, i, i + 1) for i in range(1, n)]
x = np.r_[0, x]
y = np.r_[0, y]
z = np.r_[1, z]
t = np.r_[0, t]

# ==== Code added for fixing the viewpoint ====
figure = mlab.figure()
scene = figure.scene
scene.x_minus_view()
scene.camera.position = [-1.1437838116861252, -2.116527050821497, 5.572515456581492]
scene.camera.focal_point = [-0.04951556604879043, 0.0, 0.5]
scene.camera.view_angle = 30.0
scene.camera.view_up = [0.8794813509054432, 0.34100117306501826, 0.33201017059394156]
scene.camera.clipping_range = [3.545571276948115, 8.209200934599123]
scene.camera.compute_view_plane_normal()
scene.render()
# ====================

mlab.triangular_mesh(x, y, z, triangles, scalars=t)
mlab.show()
```

- That's it. Now everytime you run the Python program, Mayavi uses the defined viewpoint
{% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/draw_mayavi/8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
